                <h2>Who I am</h2>
                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi, I'm Mark Hill. I have experience in a variety of fields, but currently am working as a freelance front-end web developer. Though I'm from America I currently live in Japan with my wife and our dachshund. I am a native English speaker but can also speak conversational Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese.</p>
                <h3>My Interests</h3>
                <p>I am interested in a lot of different things, including nature, travel, language, culture, religion, game design, books, health, education, etc. In the past I have worked in localization and game development, but am now excited at the many possible applications of web development. My wife can attest to my passion for programming. She has stopped me to ask if we can talk about anything other than web development many times!</p>
                <h3>What I'm learning</h3>
                <p>I have been studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have been putting them to good use making projects for myself and others. Beyond those basics I have been learning about Sass/SCSS, Flexbox, CSS Grid, Git and GitHub, Bootstrap, working with JSON, working with API's, etc. Though I prefer the front-end I've even dipped my toes in the back-end in order to launch a website for a small CPA Firm.</p>
                <h3>Where I want to go next</h3>
                <p>In the near future I plan to continue to learn more about web development and sharpen my skills, make more projects, and eventually move out of freelance work and find a company to work for part or full time.</p>
